        </div>

        <p class="main_para">Gold in its natural state is a shiny yellow 
metal. It is an extremely rare element found 
on earth which is why it costs so much.
It is the softest out of all metals on 
the periodic table and can be shaped into 
nearly anything. Gold is also very heavy and 
dense for a metal that is that soft. Gold much 
like copper is very good at conducting heat and 
electricty. Like aluminium it also doesnâ€™t 
rust and errode as much compared to 
other metals.
